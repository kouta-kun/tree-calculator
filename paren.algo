(3 + 2) * 5
find + at [3],
search unbalanced close parenthesis, find at [6] so fall through
find * at [8],
search unbalanced close parenthesis, not found so binaryop is parse('(3 + 2)', '5')
'(3 + 2)' starts and ends with () so replace with '3 + 2'
final tree is (* 5 (+ 3 2))

2 + (3 / 5)
find + at [2],
